      <p><span className="indent"></span>The Pasig River Expressway (PAREX) is a planned 19.37 km six-lane elevated expressway proposed by the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) that would extend along and on top of the Pasig River, connecting the Radial Road 10 in Manila to the C-6 Road in Taguig. According to the SMC, the proposed expressway would decrease traffic congestion and travel time within Metro Manila, as well as clean up the Pasig River. However, concerns have been raised that the project would ultimately do more harm than good [1].</p>
      <p><span className="indent"></span>Despite SMC’s claim that PAREX would help decongest Metro Manila traffic, its construction could actually have the opposite effect. According to the concepts of induced demand and the Braess Paradox, constructing additional roadways would only encourage more people to drive private vehicles, leading to increases in traffic congestion and travel time [2][3]. Subsequently, the greater volume of vehicle traffic would generate more pollution in the area [4].</p>
      <p><span className="indent"></span>In addition to that, road construction has direct and non-direct impact to its surrounding area. Blockage of sunlight harms photosynthetic organisms like riverside plants important to prevent riverbank erosion [5], and aquatic plants and phytoplanktons that provide oxygen and serve as food for possible aquatic life [6][7]. PAREX could also decrease heat sink or cooling effects of Pasig river which, with its size, provides significant daytime temperature drops especially near its vicinity [8].</p>
      <p><span className="indent"></span>We believe that the construction of PAREX is a solution that neglects the real problem of Manila’s traffic i.e. the poor public transportation system needed by the majority.  Its creation will only encourage more private vehicle ownership which is not sustainable in the long run. In addition to that: construction noise and dust pollution, and potential disruption of a possible river ecosystem for future rehabilitation. We need better public transportation, not more roads! And true rehabilitation of the Pasig river because it is not dead and we should not let it be!</p>
