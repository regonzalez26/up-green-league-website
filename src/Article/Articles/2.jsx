      <p><span className="indent"></span>The construction of Kaliwa Dam has been proposed as a solution to Metro Manila’s water security crisis but it easily became a major threat to the biodiversity of the construction site, especially to the ancestral domains of more than 300 Dumagat-Remontados indigenous people who will need to relocate due to the said project [1].</p>
      <p><span className="indent"></span>For the project to push through, a Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of the affected indigenous people [2] is required first by law. The project failed to secure an FPIC. Yet it was issued an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) [1][3].</p>
      <p><span className="indent"></span>The non-profit organization Initiative PH has reported that Dumagat-Remontados katutubos have been excluded from a recent signing of a memorandum of agreement (MOA) in General Nakar, Quezon. The venue for the discussion required the katutubos to undergo antigen testing, a practice that goes against their indigenous culture. As of writing, no law requires testing nor vaccination for government transactions [4]. The MOA was eventually signed without the katutubos present.</p>
      <p><span className="indent"></span>The UP Green League calls out to the NCIP and MWSS to practice inclusion and transparency in its legal agreements especially when indigenous people’s ancestral domain, their home, is on the line. COVID testing should not be a hindrance to inclusion as there are measures to proceed without the need for such, e.g. social distancing and PPE wearing. We urge to uphold justice and ultimately to stop the development of the Kaliwa Dam!</p>
